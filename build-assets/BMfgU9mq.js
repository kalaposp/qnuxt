It features refined vacuum tube circuits, which we have enhanced with several additional functionalities, including the Automatic Bias System, Filament Soft-Start, Relay Controlled Input Selection and Volume – just to name a few. Our sonic vision was clear: to create a smooth, musical, and well-balanced vacuum tube amplifier that excels across the entire audio frequency spectrum.

",-1),fe=e("br",null,null,-1),be=e("p",{class:"leading-relaxed"}," As always, the most important aspect of the design process was to meet the widest possible range of user needs. Starting at the inputs, we have 4 UNBALANCED and 2 BALANCED line level inputs and a MM PHONO level input available. On the output side, the C200 is equipped with 2 UNBALANCED line level outputs (one of which can be connected to a subwoofer), we also have a BALANCED line level output and a HEADPHONE connection for dynamic headphones. With this set of I/O ports, users have plenty of options to connect the C200 into their system. And best of all, each output port carries the characteristics of classic Tungsram tube sound, while interference and noise levels have been reduced to the absolute minimum. ",-1),we=e("br",null,null,-1),xe=e("p",{class:"leading-relaxed"}," Along with the C200, we are also introducing an updated remote control, on which, in addition to the previous VOLUME UP, VOLUME DOWN and MUTE buttons, there is also a POWER ON/STANDBY button. After pressing this button, a circuit provides 1 minute of wake-up / warm-up time for the tubes. After this time, the C200's outputs will become active and ready for use.

It also prevents the sensitive, high permeability transformer cores from saturating by precisely equalizing the quiescent currents of the power tubes. Finally, the bias system has a built-in soft-start function too, which prevents the tubes from drawing excessive current during start-up and eliminates pops and noises during power-up. The above means that no further adjustment is required once the electron tubes supplied with the unit have been installed, the circuit automatically takes care of everything.

Line level and subwoofer outputs are absolute necessary in this category, these ports are included on the back. We've added a real specialty too: a built-in, studio grade Parallel Equalizer. This kind of tools is primarily used as a master channel effect in recording studios, to bring fresh air into the mix, as a finishing touch. We've found that this effect can also be a huge help at home as well, as it can breath new life into certain, not so vivid records.
