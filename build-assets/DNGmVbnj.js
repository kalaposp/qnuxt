Its outstanding sonic properties led us to name our top-of-the-line integrated amplifier after this phenomenal power tube. Its high linearity and low distortion serve as the perfect basis for the amplifier's power block, in which we combine it with our own custom output transformer for excellent low and high frequency behavior. Additionally, we have integrated the newest iteration of our Automatic Bias System for continuous and precise control of the quiescent currents, providing a seamless user experience.

This meticulous design ensures optimal performance across both low and high frequencies. Once the winding is complete, the transformers are encased in metal shielding cans to minimize electromagnetic interference. Finally, they are potted using an epoxy compound to eliminate mechanical vibrations and associated noises. ")]),_:1})]))}};export{E as default};
