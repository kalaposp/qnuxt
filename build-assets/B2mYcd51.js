In the turbulent years following World War II, a state-owned company called RAFILM from Budapest was initially responsible for meeting both professional and home audio needs in the country. In 1951, the name of the company was first changed to AUDIO, and then to EAG in 1956. However, they couldn’t use this name for too long due to its great similarity to the German company AEG. Consequently, in 1960, the name was changed to BEAG, which stands for Budapesti Elektroakusztikai Gyár."},{title:"BEAG-Universil in Nyíregyháza",label:"Professional Audio Roots",date:"1970s",src:"/img/story/trafo-tekeres_jav.png",alt:"alt-text",content:"BEAG placed increasing emphasis on the production of professional studio equipment and established a production plant in our city in 1971.
