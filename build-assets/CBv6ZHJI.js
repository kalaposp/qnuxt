This amplifier harmoniously blends our classic heritage with modern details: it features refined vacuum tube circuits, which we have enhanced with several additional functionalities. In shaping the overall sound character, our primary goal was to move away from the pronounced coloration often associated with amplifiers utilizing the 300B tube. Instead, we envisioned a smooth, musical and balanced vacuum tube amplifier that excels across the entire audio frequency range.
