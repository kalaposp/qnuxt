As creators, we define with our product what we think an audio amplifier should be. In this role, we do our job well if there are many people who enjoy listening to music on our components, if they also consider the same things important in a sound reproduction that we do.

We started making amplifiers of our own design for the same reason: we didn't really find any currently manufactured audio amplifier on the market that we ourselves would have liked to use in our own system.

In this sense, systems containing vacuum tube elements are often characterized by the words: warm, natural, detailed, open, clear, etc. In practice, the situation is obviously more complex, but these descriptions generally apply to well-designed tube amplifiers. All of this is connected to the aesthetic and technical nostalgia of electron tubes, which is inseparably present in such an audio device.
