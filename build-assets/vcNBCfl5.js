This amplifier harmoniously blends our classic heritage with modern details: it features refined vacuum tube circuits, which we have enhanced with several additional functionalities. In shaping the overall sound character, our primary goal was to move away from the pronounced coloration often associated with amplifiers utilizing the 300B tube. Instead, we envisioned a smooth, musical and balanced vacuum tube amplifier that excels across the entire audio frequency range.

Originally developed by Western Electric in the mid-1930s for amplifying audio in movie theaters, it later became a favorite among audiophiles and one of the most successful vacuum tubes in history. Its outstanding sonic properties led us to name our top-of-the-line integrated amplifier after this phenomenal power tube. Its high linearity and low distortion serve as the perfect basis for the amplifier's power block, in which we combine it with our own custom output transformer for excellent low and high frequency behavior. Additionally, we have integrated the newest iteration of our Automatic Bias System for continuous and precise control of the quiescent currents, providing a seamless user experience.

Our output transformers are constructed using high-permeability, large cross-section toroidal magnetic cores, which undergo initial impregnation during the production process. Following this, the winding process begins, utilizing a multi-layered, sectioned, and specially arranged winding configuration. This meticulous design ensures optimal performance across both low and high frequencies. Once the winding is complete, the transformers are encased in metal shielding cans to minimize electromagnetic interference. Finally, they are potted using an epoxy compound to eliminate mechanical vibrations and associated noises. ")]),_:1})]))}};export{V as default};
