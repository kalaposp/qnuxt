    "content": "philosophy the driving force behind qualiton audio products introduction the qualiton brand name comes from the blending of the words qualityand tone and was first used in the companys 1970s era we felt that this little play on words faithfully reflects everything that our current products also represent the high quality intermediary role of our audio components that forges a very close bond between the piece of music and the listener during a listening session our role as manufacturers our role is twofold we are both creators and passionate music lovers as creators we define with our product what we think an audio amplifier should be in this role we do our job well if there are many people who enjoy listening to music on our components if they also consider the same things important in a sound reproduction that we do if they had to make an amplifier from scratch they would build one with the same sonic character this is the point where the circle closes and the creator becomes listener again an authentic musician writes his own songs because he wants to listen to good music music that he thinks is the best we started making amplifiers of our own design for the same reason we didnt really find any currently manufactured audio amplifier on the market that we ourselves would have liked to use in our own system in the end we found a sophisticated and captivating sound character in our vacuum tube models which we want to bring to as many audio enthusiasts as possible for many of us the devices we use to listen to music are of paramount importance since a carefully designed audio system not only does not disturb the listening experience but also enhances and deepens it in this sense systems containing vacuum tube elements are often characterized by the words warm natural detailed open clear etc in practice the situation is obviously more complex but these descriptions generally apply to welldesigned tube amplifiers all of this is connected to the aesthetic and technical nostalgia of electron tubes which is inseparably present in such an audio device key principles finally we would like to share some of the principles that we have kept in mind from the very beginning and which represent the cornerstones of the companys culture we use cookies to analyze our website traffic and performance we never collect any personal data you consent to our use of cookies if you continue to use this site ",
